I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with hands-on experience in network troubleshooting, penetration testing, and system security. Currently pursuing my Bachelor of General Studies at Texas State University, I have a strong foundation in IDS, Wireshark, Python, Linux, SQL, and Security Governance.

## Objective
With three years of internship experience and over two years studying cybersecurity, I am building expertise in network security, penetration testing, and security governance. Despite a non-traditional background, I have gained hands-on experience across security operations, risk management, and incident response. Currently pursuing my Security+ certification, I am eager to explore all areas of cybersecurity, from governance to red team/blue team operations, demonstrating my commitment to continuous growth in the field.
